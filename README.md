Here are the results of the Leepfrog exercise you asked me to complete.

I chose to write this in Ruby.

I spend around 7 hours on this exercise ensuring the code worked properly by writing tests.
The only differences between my results and the sample data is that my results are not formatted html (no line breaks/indenting)
and I did not add in the title and class attributes shown in the sample data. These could be added in by updating the HtmlBuilder
class to accommodate for optional attributes to be passed in, and then the html generator would need to be updated accordingly.
I used the sample data for my test cases, and removed the extra whitespace and attributes to agree with the previous statement.

Note: The progsample file is not in the Github repository, since I did not want it to become public.

To run this exercise, execute the run_me.rb script with `ruby run_me.rb`.

You can also modify this class if you would like to test with different campuses and paths.

This was a fun exercise to work on, although the recursion gave me some troubles :). Please let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks!
